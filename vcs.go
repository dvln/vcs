// Package vcs provides the ability to work with varying version control systems
// (VCS),  also known as source control systems (SCM) though the same interface.
//
// This package includes a function that attempts to detect the repo type from
// the remote URL and return the proper type. For example,
//
//     remote := "https://github.com/Masterminds/vcs"
//     wkspc, _ := ioutil.TempDir("", "go-vcs")
//     vcsReader, err := vcs.NewReader(remote, wkspc)   // add VCS Type if known
//
// In this case vcs will use a GitReader instance. NewReader can detect the VCS
// for numerous popular VCS and from the URL. For example, a URL ending in .git
// that's not from one of the popular VCS will be detected as a Git repo and
// the correct reader type will be returned.
//
// If you know the VCS system type and would like to create an instance of a
// specific type you can add it as an optional 3rd param to NewReader or you
// can use one of the constructurs for specific VCS types, via calls to
// NewGitReader, NewSvnReader, NewBzrReader, and NewHgReader.
//
// Once you have an object implementing a VCS Reader interface the operations
// are the same no matter which VCS you're using. There are some caveats. For
// example, each VCS has its own revision formats that need to be respected and
// to checkout a branch, if a branch is being worked with, is different in
// each VCS.  These revisions are passed as type 'Rev' which is just essentially
// a string but when revisions are read a Revision struct can be populated with
// more extensive data about a given revision if desired (raw VCS revision, tags,
// branches, timestamp, etc)
