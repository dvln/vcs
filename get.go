// Getter provides a small interface to work with different VCS systems with

	// RevSet matches the RevSet() interface sig from RevSetter. Due to Go's
    // design here can't just make this a RevSetter since the overall Reader
	// in repo.go includes RevReader and the Getter interface (and how Go works
    // is a compile error indicating duplicate method names)

// NewGetter returns a VCS Getter based on the given VCS description info about
// the remote (URL typically) and workspace (dir/path) locations.  If the VCS info
// is minimal (eg: not a full URL with scheme) then this will try and detect
// VCS type (if unable to determine an ErrCannotDetectVCS will be returned).
