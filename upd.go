// Updater provides a small interface to work with different VCS systems with
// respect to bringing in and "merging" remote VCS changes into an existing
// local workspace clone (and any local changes).  A Describer interface
// comes in as a parameter to get local wkspc path and remote location info
// and Exists from the Existence intfc is also needed (sometimes)..
// Note: do not use the interface Existence as it will conflict and result
//       in build errors since the Existence itfc also is a Describer
type Updater interface {
	// Describer access to VCS system details (Remote, WkspcPath, ..)
    Describer

	// Exists will determine if the repo exists (remotely or in local wkspc)
	Exists(Location) (bool, error)

	// Update is used to merge with new central repo changes to local
    // workspace, optionally at a given revision (specific single revision)
	Update(...Rev) (string, error)
}

// NewUpdater returns a VCS Updater based on the given VCS description info about
// the remote (URL typically) and workspace (dir/path) locations.  If the VCS info
// is minimal (eg: not a full URL with scheme) then this will try and detect
// VCS type (if unable to determine an ErrCannotDetectVCS will be returned).
// Note: This function can make network calls to try to determine the VCS
